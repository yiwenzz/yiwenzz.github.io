I hold an undergraduate\r\ndegree in pure mathematics and a master’s degree in urban planning,\r\nwhere I focused on applied research methods. Over the past four years,\r\nmy PhD studies in public administration have equipped me with robust\r\ntheoretical frameworks. My passion for interdisciplinary research is\r\nevident in my diverse academic background, as I strongly believe that\r\naddressing complex social issues requires a multidimensional\r\napproach.\r\nThe goals I set when I first applied for the doctoral program remain\r\nunchanged: identify issues, gather evidence, develop solutions, and\r\ninform practice. As my research has evolved, it has centered on urban\r\nplanning, environmental justice, social equity, and hazard risk\r\nreduction. I am committed to advancing scholarship in these areas and\r\nchampioning efforts that will benefit future generations.\r\n\r\n\r\nContact Information\r\nyiwen@ku.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeer-reviewed Publications\r\nWu, Yiwen, Ward Lyles, Kelly Overstreet, and Elaina Sutley. “Planning\r\nfor Adaptation?
