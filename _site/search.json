My very shallow\r\nknowledge in climate change science makes wonder what human beings can\r\ndo to alleviate the suffering even with irreversible climate change\r\neffects. Combining my previous trained experience in math and urban\r\nplanning, I build models to analyze the effectiveness of local planning\r\npolicy in mitigating and adapting climate change.\r\nEducation:\r\nB.S. in Mathematics, University of Wisconsin-Platteville\r\nM.U.P. in Urban Planning, University of Kansas, Lawrence\r\nLanguage\r\nChinese and English\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
