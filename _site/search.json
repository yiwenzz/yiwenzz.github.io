I hold an undergraduate degree in pure mathematics and a master’s degree in urban planning. During my master’s in planning, I gained extensive training in applied research methods. Over the past four years of doctoral studies in public administration and environmental planning, I’ve established well-grounded theoretical frameworks for my dissertation focusing on expanding government capacity for building resilient communities leveraging Planning Consultants.\r\nMy passion for interdisciplinary research is evident in my diverse academic training and my collaborative scholarly publications. I strongly believe that addressing complex issues like climate change and environmental planning requires integrated knowledge and collective efforts. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the body of scholarly literature on climate resilience while fostering positive outcomes for local communities.\r\nTo achieve the objective of climate resilience, my research and teaching are anchored in themes such as environmental justice, social equity, and hazard risk reduction. I am dedicated to advancing scholarly discourse in these areas while actively promoting initiatives that will yield tangible benefits for both future generations and marginalized communities.\r\nContact Information\r\nyiwen@ku.edu\r\n\r\n\r\nPeer-reviewed Publications\r\nWu, Yiwen, Ward Lyles, Kelly Overstreet, and Elaina Sutley. “Planning for Adaptation?

A student-centered approach requires understanding and addressing their varied goals and needs. I set flexible learning objectives that provide both a low entry point and high expectations. The flexibility allows students to focus on core concepts while maintaining the space to pursue advanced topics with my full support.\r\nLearning as An Opportunity for Personal Growth\r\nTeaching offers valuable opportunities for educators to grow and continuously refine their approach by understanding students’ evolving needs. In courses on planning and public administration, teaching requires addressing both broad and specific challenges, as students often raise questions that challenge conventional practices. Rather than providing direct answers, it is important to encourage students to explore their curiosities and engage in self-directed research. This approach values critical inquiry and deep engagement over unreflective responses. Additionally, fostering a supportive academic community is essential. I have been deeply involved in promoting graduate student growth and resilience, co-directing initiatives like the Graduate Student Collective, which provided resources and opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, skill-building, and professional development. Through this, I aim to contribute to the personal and academic development of students, both inside and outside the classroom.\r\nAdaptability in Learning\r\nTo make learning more accessible, I offered various formats including synchronous and asynchronous options with recorded lectures, to accommodate diverse student needs, particularly those facing transportation or health issues like Covid.\r\nCourses Taught\r\nPUAD 332 - Quantitative Method in Public Administration\r\nDesigned and taught the course alone.\r\nCourse description: this course focuses on building the quantitative analysis skills of students in public administration. Students learn basic and intermediate statistics, and methods of data analysis and interpretation. Students gain exposure to the uses of data in public organizational settings.\r\n\r\nUrban Planning 200 - Sustainability\r\nCo-taught the course.\r\nCourse description: this course introduces the concept of sustainability, examining its early iterations, recent applications, and possible future transformations. Critical analysis of sustainability as a concept and societal goal will be a course cornerstone. We examine two contemporary social issues that are relevant to students at the University of Kansas. Social science perspectives are emphasized, but, because sustainability necessitates an interdisciplinary perspective, the course considers the contributions of a wide range of disciplines to these issues.\r\n\r\nUrban Planning 710 - Housing Policy and Planning\r\nCo-taught the course.\r\nCourse description: this course explores contemporary U.S. housing issues and introduces the various methods used by the public sector as it intervenes in housing markets. Governments at all levels employ many different approaches to achieve housing goals. This course will examine many of these approaches to help students understand what these housing programs are supposed to accomplish and how well they work. In all cases, the objective of the course is to educate planners so that they have a firm understanding of housing programs that exist and a grasp of the methods used to select housing strategies for implementation by the public sector.\r\n\r\nPublic Administration 836 - Data Informed Decision-Making\r\nServed as Graduate Teaching Assistant.\r\nCourse description: this course examines an array of data analysis tools that, when mastered, will increase students’ abilities to analyze, synthesize, think creatively, solve problems, and make decisions. It covers concepts of research design, probability, inferential statistics, and introduces quantitative approaches to examine public management and public policy decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
