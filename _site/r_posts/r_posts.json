All counties are evenly divided into three tiers:\nTier 1: population size from 3,000 to 11,000 (33 counties)\nTier 2: population size form 11,000 to 20,000 (33 counties)\nTier 3: population size form 20,000 to 48,200 (33 counties)\n\nCorrelations between:\nNumber of bechelor received and number of poverty.\nMedian house value and the mean of income.\nNumber of employed and the mean of income.\nNumber of employed and the number under poverty.\n\nT test.\nAll data are collected through the U.S. Census at https://www.census.gov/.\nMethods\nload Packages\nIn order to accomplish these following tasks:\nData manipulation\nCorrelation\nHistogram Visualization\n2-sample t test\n\nI use the these following packages in R:\n\n\n\nImport Data\nI used a .csv file to store all collected data from the U.S. Census.\nMy target are 99 counties of the state of Iowa.\n\n\n\nCheck Variables\nBy using head, we are able to check all variables\ncollected for future data analysis. From U.S. Census Data, I collected\nthe following data as my variables: data2010 population, 2017\npopulation, number of bachelor obtained for over 25 year-old, population\ncount that is below poverty, mean of income, and the median house\nvalue\n\n              Id             Geography pop.2010 pop.2017 by.pop\n1 0500000US19003    Adams County, Iowa     4029     3686      1\n2 0500000US19159 Ringgold County, Iowa     5131     5034      1\n3 0500000US19009  Audubon County, Iowa     6119     5578      1\n4 0500000US19143  Osceola County, Iowa     6462     6045      1\n5 0500000US19173   Taylor County, Iowa     6317     6178      1\n6 0500000US19185    Wayne County, Iowa     6403     6476      1\n  Over25.Bach below.poverty median.house mean.income employed\n1         357           418        84900       76251     5935\n2         521           518        79600       77205     3116\n3         414           614        68800       79727    11189\n4         595           689        89500       73473    10108\n5         446           668        76100       74703     4783\n6         416          1001        74700       65938    20110\n\nUnivariate Statistics\nBy running summary, we are able to learn some basic\nstatistics of our dataset.

However, the\ntruth can be: the more bechalors a county has, the bigger population it\nmay have. Therefore, it is more likely to have more people under\npoverty.\n\n[1] 0.9541034\n\nCorrelation\nbetween median house value and mean of income.\nThere is a strong positive correlation between median house value and\nthe average income.\n\n[1] 0.8414412\n\nCorrelation\nbetween number of employed and mean of income.\nIt is very likely that there is no correlation between number of\nemployed and the mean of income.\n\n[1] 0.04853983\n\nCorrelation\nbetween number of employed and number under poverty.\nIt is very likely that there is no correlation between number of\nemployed and the number under poverty\n\n[1] -0.004254535\n\nT- test\nNull: the means of income are the same.\nAlternative: they are not the same.\n\n\n    Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  my_data$pop.2017 and my_data$mean.income\nt = -8.3951, df = 196, p-value = 9.212e-15\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -61594.95 -38160.87\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n 31774.86  81652.77 \n\nThe p-value is smaller than 0.05. There is significant evidence to\nreject the null hypothesis. The means of income are not the same for\ncounties with different population sizes.\n\n\n\n",
