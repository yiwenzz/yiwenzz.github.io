    "contents": "\nBinet’s Formula\nThe Binet’s formula is also known as the explicit expression of\nn-th term of the Fibbonacci Sequence.\nBrief Introduction\nCounting is a very basic skill. We have all been learning how to\ncount since we were very young. If we think back to our childhood, other\nthan simple vocabulary like “daddy” and “mommy”, the most common thing\nwas to count the numbers from one to ten. In this case, counting could\nbe the first exposure to mathematics for old math traditions. Now, we\nstill count in daily life, for instance, money exchange, time\nmanagement, fortune accumulation, etc. However, the beauty of counting\nis more than that. We can apply the concept of counting in various\nmathematical problems and proofs. Binet’s formula, in another name the\ngolden ratio, can be proved.\nTools\nI employed counting’s principle, DIE method by modern mathematician\nDoron Zeiberger. Principles in combinatorics are pioneered by modern\nmathematician Benjamin and Quinn. Without all knowledge above, there is\nno such proof can be exsited. Contact for more information.\nAnother version\nYou may find this formula and proof useful.\nA\nProof of Binet’s Formula\n\n\n\n",
