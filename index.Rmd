## About Me
I am a PhD candidate in the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas. I hold an undergraduate degree in pure mathematics and a master's degree in urban planning, where I focused on applied research methods. Over the past four years, my PhD studies in public administration have equipped me with robust theoretical frameworks. My passion for interdisciplinary research is evident in my diverse academic background, as I strongly believe that addressing complex social issues requires a multidimensional approach.

The goals I set when I first applied for the doctoral program remain unchanged: identify issues, gather evidence, develop solutions, and inform practice. As my research has evolved, it has centered on urban planning, environmental justice, social equity, and hazard risk reduction. I am committed to advancing scholarship in these areas and championing efforts that will benefit future generations.
