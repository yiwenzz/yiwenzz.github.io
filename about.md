I'm currently a doctoral student in the Department of Educational Measurement & Statistics at the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/). I basically use this site to show my recent, current, and future works as well as some tutorials about R programming in a way that tries to make my efforts more interactive. 

My research interests are mostly focused on the development of psychometric and general quantitative methods, as applied in the psychological, educational, and social sciences. I'm now the Graduate Teaching Assistant of Multivariate Statistics.
